# Agents

Before making any decisions or changes read [README.md](./README.md) for context about the DiglyAI project and [runtime/README.md](runtime/README.md) for DiglyAI Runtime information.

Prefer clean code that is easy to read and maintain. Avoid clever or complex solutions unless absolutely necessary.

DiglyAI is in early development and breaking changes are acceptable and encouraged if they improve the project.

When asked about YAML manifests, never consider controller changes unless explicitly asked to.
