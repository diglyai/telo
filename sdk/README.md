# Digly SDKs

This directory hosts language‑specific SDKs for building Digly modules. Each SDK exposes the same conceptual contract (module lifecycle, contexts, and resource execution) while remaining idiomatic to its language ecosystem.

## Available SDKs

- **Node.js**: `sdk/nodejs/README.md`

## Status

Early prototype. APIs and contracts are still evolving. The API surface - including YAML shapes - may change at any time without notice.
